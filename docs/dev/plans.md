# Developer plans

## Web-based

The version of the editor that I worked on last expected to be running on a server in order to save the JSON and other game assets. There's not really any reason this can't be done 100% in the browser.

## Portable and easy to run

My vision is to be able to build a game using the editor and to be able to **export** the game which will spit out a zip file that's setup to play the game without the editor.

This would make it pretty easy to deploy a game to the public using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) or on [Itch.io](https://itch.io/docs/creators/html5).

## Shareable

Given the direction that I want to take this, I think it makes sense to give thought toward being able to share the games that you make in Yggy.
