# Dev log 1

Alright, the project is *somewhat* in a closer position to how I want. That is:

- I've implemented a service worker which acts similar to the `editor-server` that the editor expects to be running under.
- The editor still works on a copy of the game assets via localstorage, and now the service worker Pushes and Pulls Changes to/from the browser's IndexedDB.

I'm not sure that usability has improved from these changes, but this sort of structure is what I had in mind when I decided to return to the project. There seems to be some issues with keeping state in-sync properly.
