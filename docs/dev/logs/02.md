# Dev log 2

This iteration is about using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) for the editor. I've done this quite a few times so the setup isn't too bad.

## _A couple days later_

I woke up to a less-than-functional dialogue tree today and can't manage to reconcile issues with duplicate dialogue nodes.

I'll be stopping here I think, for now at least.

- The editor is setup to use vue
- The Dialogue tab works
- The Tree tab renders mostly unstyled and not really functionally
- No other tabs are implemented

So yeah, the Tree broke me.
