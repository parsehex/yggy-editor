# Dev planning

This is where I'm dumping bullet points that talk about decisions I need to make and tasks I'm working on, etc.

- It'll be good to have a view of the data with IndexedDB, in addition to one for localstorage. Saying it out loud, I think a component makes sense which takes either idb or ls and renders its content.
  - In terms of tab placement, I'm thinking: 1) Put this view/component in "Utilities" tab, 2) rename Utilities to Tools to save some space
- finish setting up and using vue
- (more to be done/added here. e.g.:)
- I want to use shadcn components overall and style them to look ~~shitty~~ unpolished like it is now, but specifically I want to use their [Resizeable](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/resizable.html) component between the game and editor.
  - I might explore how easy it would be to offer layout options for these and maybe more panels
