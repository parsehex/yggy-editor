# Changes

This isn't necessarily a full list of changes. Noteworthy behavior of new features will be listed here.

## v0.3.0

This is the first version that I've worked on to run the editor fully on the browser.

## v0.2.1

- After uploading an image file, the editor auto-creates a new Image data asset.
	- Note that this created Image acts the same as it did. So if you Clear changes then it'll be lost but the image file will still be in the editor.

## v0.2.0

- Add the ability for multiple (2) character to appear at once.
	- The editor (intentionally) won't allow you to set the same character for both characters.
	- With this you now must set which character "owns" the dialogue (i.e. who is talking).
		- For convenience the label in the editor is called "Talking:"
		- If you go from having no characters in the dialogue (and therefore no owner), setting a character will make that character the owner.
